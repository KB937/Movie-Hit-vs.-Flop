# Movie-Hit-vs.-Flop-Classifier
The film industry is a high-risk business where investments often exceed $100 million. Predicting financial success solely based on "gut feeling" is insufficient. 
This project builds a **Risk Assessment Model** to predict whether a movie will be a **Hit** or a **Flop** *before* it enters production, using data available at the script/planning stage.

### The Problem
*   **High Sunk Costs:** Movies are "single-shot" products. A Flop results in massive financial loss.
*   **Goal:** Identify high-risk projects (Flops) to save investors money.
